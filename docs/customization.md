## Mix contents from other theme styles

For example, if you want to use theme __default__ style as the main theme, but also want to display other content blocks from __LaParis II__ style. You can edit the template files, rearrange, add more content blocks or delete unused content blocks.

Let open folder `templates` > `components` > `emthemes-modez` > `home` in the template files editor:

![Edit template file home default](img/edit-file-home-default.png)

There is 2 files in this folder:

- `default.html`: is used for __default__ style.
- `laparis2.html`: is used for __LaParis II__ style.

Let's take a look at contents of 2 files:

__default.html__

```plain
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="banner_laparis1_1"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="new_products"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="categories_featured"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="popular_products"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="blog_recent"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="brands_carousel"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="instagram_grid"}}
```

__laparis2.html__

```plain
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="products_by_category_1"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="products_by_category_2"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="carousel_laparis2_1"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="special_products_columns"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="brands_carousel"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="instagram_grid"}}
```

The files are showing very clearly how content blocks are displayed. See values in parameter `section="..."`:

- `banner_laparis1_1`: Is the first block content 3 banners in the homepage of default style.
- `new_products`: Is a block contains new products.
- `categories_featured`: Is a block contains featured products with categories list as appeared on the homepage of default style.
- `popular_products`: Is a block contains popular (or bestselling) products.
- `blog_recent`: Is a block contains recent blog posts.
- `brands_carousel`: Is a brand images carousel.
- `instagram_grid`: Is a block displaying instagram photos.
- `products_by_category_1` & `products_by_category_2`: Is a block contains product in a certain category as showing on homepage of LaParis II style.
- `carousel_laparis2_1`: Is the image carousel as showing on homepage of LaParis II style.
- `special_products_columns`: Is a block contains 3 columns showing new products, featured products and bestselling products as displayed on homepage of LaParis II style.

So just copy a line from the other file to the other. Arrange position of these sections as you wish.

Example of a mixed __default.html__:

```plain
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="new_products"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="popular_products"}}

{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="products_by_category_2"}}
{{> components/emthemes-modez/sections/section section="instagram_grid"}}

```
